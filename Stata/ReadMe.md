##### Description of the Stata folder.  
To reproduce the data for the foreign assistance map download the three .do files in the Stata folder and run them in order, paying close attention to the details in each do file. Because the foreign assistance data is updated from time to time, it may be necessary to modify the code to injest and process new data.
